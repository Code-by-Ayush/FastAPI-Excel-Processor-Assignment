## Missed Edge Cases

   Need checks for empty or invalid files with proper error messages.

2. **Duplicate Row Names**  
   Handle or prevent non-unique row names in the same section.

3. **Non-Numeric Rows**  
   Warn when a row has no numeric data instead of returning zero silently.

3. **Missing/Corrupted Excel Files**  
   Provide clearer errors if the Excel file is missing or unreadable.
