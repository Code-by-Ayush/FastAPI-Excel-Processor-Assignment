# FastAPI-Excel-Processor-Assignment

This project is a FastAPI-based RESTful API that reads and serves structured data from an Excel spreadsheet (`capbudg.xlsx`). 
It allows users to:
- List section/table names extracted from the Excel file.
- View the rows in a given section.
- Compute the sum of numeric values in a specified row.

---

## Features

- List all tables/sections in the Excel workbook.
- Fetch row names for a specified table.
- Compute the sum of numeric values in a specific row.

## Project Structure

```
├── main.py              # FastAPI app with defined routes
├── utils.py             # Excel parsing and data processing logic
├── requirements.txt     # Python dependencies
└── Data/
    └── capbudg.xlsx     # Input Excel file
```

## Requirements

Install dependencies using pip:

```cmd
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## How to Run

1. Start the FastAPI server:
```cmd
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 9090
```

2. Access the API at: http://localhost:9090/

## Excel Parsing Logic

The Excel file is parsed with the following assumptions:
- Section headers are **uppercase** or end with `"="` and contain fewer than 4 filled cells.
- Each section consists of rows with a label in the first column and values in the rest.
